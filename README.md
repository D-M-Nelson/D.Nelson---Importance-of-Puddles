Project Introduction:
The tidal mudflats of San Francisco Bay provide critical wintering and stopover habitat for migratory shorebirds
(Mathot et al., 2018). These mudflats offer nutrient rich macroinvertebrates and microphytobenthos
biofilms (MPB) high in fatty acids that are vital food sources needed to carry these shorebirds thousands of
miles up and down the Pacific Flyway (Quinn et al., 2017). Unfortunately many of these energy rich tidelands
are disappearing due to anthropogenic reclamation and with the imminent threat of sea level rise (SLR) the
fate of our surviving mudflats remains imperiled (French, 1997; Stralberg et al., 2011). It’s estimated that
at least 30% of the existing mudflats in San Francisco Bay are expected to diminish in the next 50 years due
to SLR and the diversion of sediment to breached and subsided salt ponds (Valoppi, 2018). Under current
SLR predictions San Francisco Baylands, like estuaries around the globe, will experience coastal squeeze,
whereby man made structures abutting the shoreline prevent the natural climb and expansion of tideland
habitat into the uplands (Pontee, 2013) further exacerbating estuarine habitat loss.
As the persistence of these crucial habitats hangs in uncertainty, improving our understanding of the interplay
of biotic (shorebirds, MPB) and abiotic (microtopography, sedimentation patterning, elevation) features of
mudflats could provide critical insight in assessing mudflat quality and value to shorebirds (Douglas et al.,
2024). In these dynamic habitats even subtle ripples in surface sediment can influence biological patterning
in biofilm and over time lead to topographically complex mudflats with even more pronounced physical
and biological patterning (Beninger, 2018). While many studies have examined shorebird interactions with
mudflats at large spatial scales (hundreds of meters to kilometers) (e.g., (Butler et al., 2001; Hockey et al.,
1992)), few have explored this relationship at finer scales (under 10 centimeters). In this study I plan to use a
combination of unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, machine learning avian detection models, and
samples collected in the field to analyze the relationships between shorebirds and biotic and abiotic mudflat
characteristics across areas with varying sedimentary surfaces in San Francisco Bay. These remote sensing
technologies will allow me to vastly minimize site disturbance and explore fine-scale biological patterning on
mudflats as they relate to shorebird foraging. Results from my study may help prioritize mudflat preservation
and guide the optimization of existing or future habitat to support migratory shorebird success.
Hypothesis:
Through my experimental design I plan to explore if mudflats with greater rugosity (texture) will have more
diverse food resources (like MPB) than mudflats without and thereby host a greater diversity of waterbird
species. I hypothesize that small shorebirds known to forage on MPB will have longer foraging occupation
times in areas of mudflat with greater MPB density.

Specific Aim:

1) Identify which abiotic and biotic mudflat features drive shorebird foraging preference.
